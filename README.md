# AutoRail
My repository for working on the AutoRail Suite

AutoRail is a suite of programs for ComputerCraft that allows for easy train routing and time table creation using the Immersive Railroading mod for Minecraft

This is also my first Github repository so I'm still learning the ropes of this
